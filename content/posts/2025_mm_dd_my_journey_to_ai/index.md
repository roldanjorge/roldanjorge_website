# Intro
- Didn't know what to do
- Interests in Math/Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Calculus, Differential equations, Partial Differential equations, numerical methods, Scientific computing, Deep Learning


# Early beginnings
## Santa rosa
- Poor education in my home town. 
- I barely learned any Math in my high school
- Everything was a joke

## BCC 
- Engineering science 
- Math physics
- When I came to the US, I was at about intermediate algebra level
- I was clueless in terms of what I wanted to do:
    - International business (whatever that means)
    - Music
    - Engineering
- I bought Algebra books and review math concepts from Arithmethic

## CCNY
- Mechanical Engineering - 
    - Why did I get into this field?
    - Renewal 
- Deciding between:
  - Physics 
  - Applied math
  - Environmental Engineering
  - Computer Science
- About to change my major to Physics:
    - One friend convinced me to just finished what I started
- The afternoon where I decided to minor in Computer Science instead of Physics
- It was the last day to declare my minor
- I ran from Columbia to CCNY and officially declared a minor in C
- Sneaked into CS classes. List the classes 

## Applying to Grad school
- Top choice was NYU - Courant

## NYU
- Explore my incredible experience at NYU
- Hard core CS and AI education
- Incredibly dedicated teachers
