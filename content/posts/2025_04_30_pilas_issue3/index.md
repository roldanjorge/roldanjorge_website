# 1️⃣ Model Releases
## OpenAI
### GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano - 04/14/25
[Announcement](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/)
[^gpt4_1] 
OpenAI announced on April 14 three new models in their GPT series: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT 4.1 nano with a longer context, improved vision capabilities, better results across benchmarks, and a knowledge cuttoff of June 2024. These are the hightlights:

- The three GPT 4-1 models now have a longer context window of up to 1  million tokens, a significant improvement from the 128,000 window of GPT 4-o. OpenAI claims their models to understand and attend to relevant information across the full context.
- GPT 4.1 are more reliable at following instructions in areas such as following specified formats such as JSON, XML, avoiding negative behaviour, following ordered instructions, adhering to content requirements, ranking, and restraining from being too overconfident.
- For the details benchmark results and additional informaction check the [announcement](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/).


### OpenAI o3 and o4-mini - 04/16/25
[Announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/)
, [OpenAI o3 and o4-mini System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/2221c875-02dc-4789-800b-e7758f3722c1/o3-and-o4-mini-system-card.pdf)

OpenAI announced on April 16 the new reasoning models o3 and o4-mini. These are the main highlights: [^o3_o4_mini]

- o3 and o4-mini are the first models from OpenAI with access to all ChatGPT internal tools, they can use the browser, Python, and can do image and file analysis, and even customized tools using [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?api-mode=responses). They use [chain-of-thought](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts) reasoning to decide when to use the tools to formulate their answers.
- These new models are taking chain-of-thought reasoning to the next level by thinking with images improving their capabilities of solving problems that require visual understanding, they included additional details [here](https://openai.com/index/thinking-with-images/)
- OpenAI continues to scale Reinforcement Learning leveraging chain-of-thought. OpenAI claims that o3 and o4-mini are also safer by being able to reason better about safety policies through deliberative alignment [^openai_deliberative_alignment]
- OpenAI shared multiple benchmark results for o3 and o4-mini in the [release announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/) as well as safety and evaluations results in the [system card](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/2221c875-02dc-4789-800b-e7758f3722c1/o3-and-o4-mini-system-card.pdf).


## Google
### Gemini 2.5 Pro - 03/25/25
[Announcement](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/), [Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview Model Card](https://storage.googleapis.com/model-cards/documents/gemini-2.5-pro-preview.pdf) 

Google announced on March 25 an experimental version of the Gemini 2.5 Pro thinking model. 
[^gemini_2_5]. Some of its key features include enhanced reasoning, advanced coding, multimodal input support for text, images, video, and audio, and a context window of 1-million tokens as well as text-only output with a maximum of 64K tokens. Gemini 2.5 Pro leverages the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, and it was trained using [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), [ML Pathways](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/)  and [Google's Tensor Processing Unites (TPUs)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?e=48754805&hl=en).

### Gemini 2.5 Flash - 04/17/25
[Announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/) , [Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Model Card](https://storage.googleapis.com/model-cards/documents/gemini-2.5-flash-preview.pdf)

Google launched their latest Gemini 2.5 Flash model through the Gemini API on April 17. This hybrid reason model allows its users to deliverately swith thinking on and off, and even to set thinking budgets. Similarly to Gemini 2.5 Pro, this model's architecture is based on a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) and it was trained using [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), [ML Pathways](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/)  and [Google's Tensor Processing Unites (TPUs)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?e=48754805&hl=en).

## Meta
### The Llama 4 Herd - 04/05/25
[Announcement](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/), [Llama 4 - model card](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama4_omni/)

Meta released the Llama 4 herd on April 5 which consists of three open-weight multimodal models: Llama 4 Behemoth, Llama 4 Maverick and  Llama 4 Scout.  Maverick and Scout are available to download in [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama). However, Behemoth has not being released yet. Here are the main highlights: [^the_llama4_herd]
 [^llama4_model_card]

#### Model Sizes
The Llama 4 models leverage the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture which allows the model to only activate a subset of its total parameters during inference based on the selected expert. 

| Model            | Active Parameters | Total Parameters | Experts |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Llama 4 Behemoth | 288B             | 2T               | 16      |
| Llama 4 Maverick | 17B               | 400B                | 128     |
| Llama 4 Scout    | 17B               | 109B                | 16     |

#### Multimodal by design
Both Maverick and scout accept text and a maximum of 5 images as inputs, and can only output text. The support the following languages Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. However, image understanding is limited to English.

#### Inference Efficiency
Meta claims that the int4-quantized version of Llama 4 Scout fits in a single H100 GPU with a context length of 10M tokens while Llama 4 Maverick requires a "single H100 DGX host with distributed inference" and has a context length of 1M. One caveat about the context length capabilities is that they are "evaluated across 512 GPUs using 5D parallelism". 

#### Training techniques
- Llama 4 was pretrained on 200 languages. A total of more than 30 trillion tokens from a data mixture including text, image, and video datasets which is more than double the data used for Llama 3.
- Meta optimized training by using FP8 precision during pre-training with 32K GPUs, achieving 390 TFLOPs/GPU.
- Meta developed MetaP, a new training technique to set hyper-parameter values including per-layer learning rates and initialization scales. 
- Meta using this pipelines of post-training techniques lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT), online reinforcement learning (RL), and lightweight direct preference optimization (DPO).
