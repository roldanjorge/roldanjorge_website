<h1 class="unnumbered" id="n-gram-language-models">3. N-gram Language
Models</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="n-grams">3.1. N-Grams</h2>
<p>N-gram models are the simplest type of language models. The N-gram
term has two meanings. One meaning refers to a sequence of n words, so a
2-gram, and 3-gram are sequences of 2, and 3 words, respectively. The
second meaning refers to a probabilistic model that estimates the
probability of a word given the n-1 previous words.</p>
<p>We represent a sequence of n words as <span class="math inline">\(w_1
\dots w_n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(w_{1:n}\)</span> , and
the join probability of each word in a sequence having a value: <span
class="math inline">\(P(W_1 = w_1, X_2=w_2, X_3=w_3, \dots, X_n =
w_n\)</span></p>
<p>To compute the probability of <span class="math inline">\(P(w_1, w_2,
\dots, w_n)\)</span> we use the chain rule of probability</p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p><span class="math display">\[P(X_1, \dots, X_n) = P(X_1) P(X_2 | X_1)
P(X_3 | X_{1:2} \dots P(X_n | X_1:{n-1})\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[P(X_1, \dots, X_n) = \prod_{k=1}^{n} P(X_k |
X_{1:k-1})\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>We apply this to words:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(w_{1:n}) = P(w_1) P(w_2|w_1)
P(w_3|w_{1:2}) \dots P(w_n|w_{1:n-1})\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(w_{1:n}) = \prod_{k=1}^{n}
P(w_k|w_{1:k-1})\]</span></p>
<p>It is still hard to compute <span
class="math inline">\(P(w_{1:n})\)</span> using the chain rule. The key
insight of the n-gram model is that we can approximate the history just
using the last few words. In the case of a bigram model, we approximate
<span class="math inline">\(P(w_n  | w_{1:n-1})\)</span> by using only
the probability of the preceding word <span
class="math inline">\(P(w_n|w_{n-1})\)</span></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p><span class="math display">\[P(w_n|w_{1:n-1}) \approx
P(w_n|w_{n-1})\]</span> An example of a <strong>Markov
assumption</strong> is when the probability of a word depends only on
the previous word in the case of a bigram, a trigram, and a n-gram looks
two words, and <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> words into the
past, respectively.</p>
<p>Generalization:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(w_n|w_{1:n-1}) \approx
P(w_n|w_{n-N+1:n-1})\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the case of the bigram, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{bigram_aprox}
    P(w_{1:n}) = \prod_{k=1}^{n} P(w_k|w_{1:k-1})
\approx  \prod_{k=1}^{n} P(w_k|w_{k-1})\]</span></p>
<p>We can estimate equation<a href="#bigram_aprox"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="bigram_aprox">[bigram_aprox]</a> using the MLE (Maximum
likelihood estimation)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(w_n | w_{n-1}) =
\frac{C(w_{n-1}w_n)}{\sum_{w} C(w_{n-1} w)}\]</span> Which can be
simplified to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(w_n | w_{n-1}) =
\frac{C(w_{n-1}w_n)}{C(w_{n-1} )}\]</span></p>
<p>We can generalize the estimation of the MLE n-gram parameter as
follows:</p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p><span class="math display">\[P(w_n|w_{n-N+1:n-1}) =
\frac{C(w_{n-N+1:n-1} \  w_n)}{C(w_{n-N+1:n-1})}\]</span> This ratio is
called the <strong>relative frequency</strong></p>

id="evaluating-language-models-training-and-test-sets">3.2. Evaluating
Language models: Training and Test sets</h2>
<p>There are different ways of evaluating a language model such as
extrinsic, and intrinsic evaluation. In extrinsic evaluation we embed
the language model i an application and measure how the applicationâ€™s
performance improves, this is a very efficient way of evaluating models,
but it is unfortunately very expensive. On the other hand, a intrinsic
evaluation metric measures the quality of a model independent of an
application, one of this metrics is the <strong>perplexity</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="types-of-datasets-for-model-evaluation">Types
of datasets for model evaluation</h3>
<p>We need at least three types of datasets for evaluating a language
model: training, development, and test sets.</p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p><strong>Training set:</strong><br />
Dataset we use to learn the parameters of our model.</p>
<p><strong>Test set:</strong> Separate dataset from the training set
used to evaluate the model. This test should reflect the language we
want to use the model for. After training two models in the training
set, we can compare how the two trained models fit the test set by
determining which model assigns a higher probability to the test set. We
only want to test the model once or very few times once on using the
test set once the model is ready.</p>
<p><strong>Development set:</strong> We use the development set to do
preliminary testing and when we are ready we only use the test set once
or very few times.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="evaluating-language-models-perplexity">3.3.
Evaluating Language models: Perplexity</h2>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p><strong>Perplexity</strong>: The perplexity (PP, PPL) of a language
model on a test set is the inverse probability of the test set (one over
the probability of the test set), normalized by the number of words.
This is why sometimes it is called per-word perplexity.</p>
<p>For a test set <span class="math inline">\(W=w_1 w_2 \dots
w_N\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
perplexity(W) &amp;= P(w_1 w_2 \dots w_N)^{-\frac{1}{N}} \\
&amp; = \sqrt[N]{\frac{1}{P(w_1 w_2 \dots w_N)}}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the chain rule we obtain: <span
class="math display">\[perplexity(W) = \sqrt[N]{\prod_{i=1}^{N}
\frac{1}{P(w_i|w_1\dots w_{i-1})}}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note that the higher the probability of a word sequence, the lower
the perplexity. Thus, the <strong>lower the perplexity of a model on the
data, the better the model.</strong>. Minimizing the perplexity is
equivalent to maximizing the test set probability according to the
language model.</p>
<p>This is how we can calculate the perplexity of a unigram language
model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[perplexity(W) = \sqrt[N]{\prod_{i=1}^{N}
\frac{1}{P(w_i)}}\]</span></p>
<p>And the same for a bigram model: <span
class="math display">\[perplexity(W) = \sqrt[N]{\prod_{i=1}^{N}
\frac{1}{P(w_i|w_{i-1})}}\]</span></p>

id="sampling-sentences-from-a-language-model">3.4. Sampling sentences
from a language model</h2>
<p>One technique to visualize the knowledge of a model is to sample from
it. Sampling from a distribution means to choose random points according
to their likelihood. Sampling from a language model, which represents a
distribution over sentences, means to generate some sentences, choosing
each sentence according to its likelihood as defined by the model.</p>
